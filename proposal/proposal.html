    <section>
      For our webpage, we plan on implementing navigational and maintenance tools for the elderly community and their caregivers
      to use in retaining control of their health. This will be done with the following features:
        <li>
            Pharmacy Locator: Users will be given a search bar to input either their locational address or a specified pharmarcy's name/address. 
            This would then direct the user to nearby pharmarcies or the requested pharmarcy, which when the geographical pointer is selected on the map UI,
            will list out details of that pharmacy (hours, phone number, etc.)
        </li>
        <li>
            Medication Management Tab: Users will be able to input information regarding their perscribed medication; name of medication, the intended dosage, time period to take medication, and other directions.
            This list can be editted if any changes are needed and can be printed out for those wanting a physical copy.
        </li>
        <li>
            Schedule Builder: Following the Medication Management Tab, users will be able to input additional information of their daily/weekly activities to combine
            an appropriate schedule showcasing the order of occurences, signifying the importance of health-related activities such as taking medication and their sleep times.
        </li>
    With these features, elderly patients will have better tools to monitor and track information related to their health, and their assigned caregivers can utilize these tools to help keep track of any important information regarding their patient,
    which can be tricky to memorize for those working with multiple people. Use of this app would not necessarily be restricted to the elder community; the general public can use these tools to organize their schedule and remind themselves of their needs.

        Additional information displayed outside the user's input would be viewed from 
        <a target="_blank" href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript">Google Maps</a> and the
        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-approvals-and-databases/drugsfda-data-files">FDA</a>,
        which would reveal the geographical locations of the pharmacies and display descriptions of the various medications available respectively. Another key viewing for the users
        arise from the infographics; An example of this being a chart displaying the recommended amount of sleep for the targeted user's situation.
