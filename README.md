2. Medication Management Tab: Users will be able to input information regarding their perscribed medication; name of medication, the intended dosage, time period to take medication, and other directions. This list can be editted if any changes are needed and can be printed out for those wanting a physical copy.

3. Schedule Builder: Following the Medication Management Tab, users will be able to input additional information of their daily/weekly activities to combine an appropriate schedule showcasing the order of occurences, signifying the importance of health-related activities such as taking medication and their sleep times.
